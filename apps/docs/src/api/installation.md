# Getting Started

### Setup with Docker Compose (main setup)
1. Navigate to `core/apps/api`

2. **Set up environment variables**:
``` bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

The example file will temporarily be empty while the this project is in early development. However, .env.local still must be made in order for Docker Compose to work.

3. Continue with the [main setup instructions](../getting-started.md)
